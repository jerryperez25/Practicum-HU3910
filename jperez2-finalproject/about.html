                        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                        <p>My name is Jerry Perez and I am currently a Senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
                            majoring in Computer Science. I hope to find full-time work in the field of Computer Science,
                             Cybersecurity, and related fields in the very near future. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout my time at WPI, I have enhanced my software development skills through project-based 
                            approaches and by actively collaborating with team members. I have an enriched programming resume
                             consisting of familiarity with Java, Python, C++, C, JavaScript, HTML, Bash, and AWS. I am accustomed
                              to dealing with challenge alongside complex problem-solving scenarios, and it is precisely these circumstances
                               that have molded me into the young man that I am today. I have always been keen on giving every task my best
                                effort while truly enjoying the process to derive a quality solution. I am extremely eager to welcome all opportunities
                                 that have to do with my desired field, whether it be educational, or for recruitment. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In fact, this website is created using HTML5, CSS,.
                            This website will be a constant work in progress... continuously revamping it as my skills improve.
